Tagging as v1.2.


--------------------

Ethan Centaurai:
	- Added plumbing for Elder NPCs in Draenor (assuming there are any).
	- Updated upvalues and fixed a leaked global.
	- Use a table of completed quests instead of Blizzard's unreliable IsQuestFlaggedComplete() API.
	- Updated README.
	- Use HandyNotes' API to get the map ID.
	- Dropped Cartographer support since it's been dead for years.
	- Use GetCurrentMapAreaID() when creating TomTom waypoints to prevent them pointing to an incorrect zone.
	- Use the CalendarGetDayEvent() API to make an automatic on/off switch. In theory.
	- Updated the dates of the 2015 Lunar Festival.
	- Bump Interface number to 60000.
	- Added an icon to show Zidormi's location, just in case the Elder in Blasted Lands is phased out due to the Iron Horde invasion.
	- Use a custom continent iterator to put marker pins on the world map.
	- Delete gitattributes and gitignore.
