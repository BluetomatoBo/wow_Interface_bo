I - OVERVIEW
********************
TargetCharms allows you to place a floating frame for easy and quick
access to assigning charms/raid icons to targets.  The series of buttons are 
highly customizable.  The user can display charms/raid icons in whatever 
arrangement and order you desire, as well as change the frame's opacity, 
location, and size. A movable "Ready Check" button and world markers/flare menu
makes it great for raid leaders!

To move icons or "Ready Check" button, right-click and drag them.  They must be set
to draggable in the setup menu to allow this.  You can ctrl+right-click the frames
to bring up the setup menu. To move the world markers you will need to use the small
drag button.
