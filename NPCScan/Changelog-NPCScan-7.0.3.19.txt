--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Implement add and remove commands; /npcscan add 22943 - also accepts "mouseover" and "target" instead of an NPC ID.
	- Go back to using UNKNOWN instead of SEARCH_LOADING_TEXT - there are more places where the latter makes absolutely no sense.
	- Add a description to the NPCsâžœCustom input box, and account for people who will include the quotes when typing "mouseover" and "target" - they are Legion. >.>
	- Display the sourceText in the detection notification.
	- Remove the queue notification toast.
	- Add Blood Seeker and Xariona, since I've been assured they are still in the game despite WoWDB and WoWHead having absolutely no location data for them.
	- Remove apparently invalid questID for Levantus, Captain Dargun, and Calamir.
