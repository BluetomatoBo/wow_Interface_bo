    Change missing questID check to not ignore the npc if it has an achievementID assigned. Instead, report missing questIDs if the npc lacks both a questID and  an achievementQuestID.

    Remove support for the Shanty Raid achievement. While it was a somewhat fun idea, only two of the six shanties were carried by NPCs, and both of them already belonged to other achievements; that isn't reason enough to add support for multiple achievements to NPCs.

    Fold body of second iteration into the first - we already have the NPC object when iterating over Maps, so ignoring it only to then iterate over NPCs to do stuff to it is insane.

    Fix several incorrect questIDs and erroneous factionGroup settings, add vignetteIDs where appropriate, and remove all World Quests save for a very few where that is the only time the NPC spawns - it was an ill-conceived idea that only served to have NPCs alert continually until said quest was back up and subsequently completed.
