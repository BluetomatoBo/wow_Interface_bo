-- Headline on Mini-mobs/Trivials, Friendly NPCs, and Non-Elite Hostiles inside instances

In LUA, short strings are hashed and referenced into a global table, so strings can be compared quickly.
a = "Text" and b = "Text"... both get the same pointer value, so using, a == b, means that the system compares the pointer rather than each letter in the string.

- Show Warning Glow on Hostile Players?  How to differentiate from Friendly and Enemy Class Colors

!! Remove "Hostile Player" color choice from HUB
!! ScaleIgnoreNonEliteUnits in instances
!! Improve aura widget Player name search
!! Headline Status Text  (Always show something?)
!! Need to make the function/token system completely robust
!! Friendly Name Color program (need a unique function set to remove "By Threat")


- Experimental Tank-Target detection;  Now treats any NPC as a tank, which should help Monks with statues, and other pet classes.

- Numerous threat fixes
- Migration of Mode Variables to Tokens

- Exclude neutral units from Low Threat warning... just show as Neutral unless they are attacking you

- Your configuration is likely going to be messed up, unless you play with defaults...
Here's the reason: In the past, your choices were listed as number (1,2,3,etc.) which corresponded to a specific function.  If the order of those functions changed, your configuration would get futzed-up.
I've changed the way that your choices are stored, so it now corresponds directly to a function, ex. "AlphaByThreat".
Sorry for the inconvenience, but this will make for a better addon in the long-run!
