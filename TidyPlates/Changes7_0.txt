ollapse the Hub panels (Damage/Healer/Tank) into a single unified panel, with a dropdown menu to select the working profile set.
- Need an "Edit" Button


* Hub: Cleaning & Refresh
* Core/Panel: Profile
* Hub: Reorganization of files
* Hub: Function Registry

When registering a Hub function, it must
	1. Add the function to the Menu List
	2. Add the function to the Function List

When Registering a Panel Widget, it must
	1. Add the widget
	2. Add the variable to the Defaults
	3. Store a default value

* Main Panel: Profile selector: Added a new set of dropdowns, to select the Hub profile.  (If you're not using a Hub theme, these will be disabled.)
* Bundled Themes: No More "/Damage" or "/Tank".... use the PROFILE selector!

* I want ONE function to add a theme to the Hub/Profile system

1.
function ApplyHubFunctions()

"Hub"
* A procedure for adding the profile choices to a list
* A procedure for building the profile menu
* A procedure for changing the variable set (integrated to the TidyPlatesPanel system)
	* If the theme has a ApplyProfile() function, enable the profile menu
	* Build/use the profile menu from GetProfileList() function
* A procedure for checking to see if the theme is a Hub-Compatible Theme
*

** Hub: Colors: Trivial Unit Color
** Hub: Filter: Override Filter for Marked Units.

Use "Tapped" color for Tapped mobs, regardless of Threat, etc.... this condition will never be found in dungeons, so it's fine to use elsewhere

** Bar Width


Combo Widget - Resource Widget
* Holy Power
* Chi
* Balance Bar

* Combo Widget Update



Only Display 'Level' in 'Level and Health' when in open world, not in raids
Adjust combo widget on Neon
Raid icon widget... moves position if...


Beta version!  Things may get broken or removed.
Need to prune down the Headline Mode thing...
Need to make it understandable.  Maybe a Graphic?

[[  Ok, guys and gals... bear with me...  ]]

This is a major update to Tidy Plates, and many little things have changed.

Localization:  This would be nice to have.  It's on my list.
