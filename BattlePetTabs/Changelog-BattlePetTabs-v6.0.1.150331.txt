WOD beta addon release.


--------------------

Vlad:
	- WOD beta release code.
	- Disable integrity checking of teams, as this seem to do more damage than good. Also changed some validation logic of pet ID to work with the changes in WoD.
	- License change. Get in touch with me if you wish to discuss.
	- Removed deprecated code and reorganized some references. Tweaked how petID related functions work, now that WOD changed the GUID entirely - again.
