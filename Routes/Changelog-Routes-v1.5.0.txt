MMOSimca:
	- Update Bindings.xml to use new Patch 6.0 key binding category system
SLOKnightfall:
	- -Updated the Localized Zone Name use SetMapByID as the MapID is now returned by GetMapZones.  Also because the zID required by SetMapZoom(cID, zID) no longer is the same as the number returned by GetMapZones. There appear to be zones that are not returned by GetMapZones (IE Warspear & Stormshield in Ashran) which throws off the map when trying to use SetMapZoom. -Changes the parent of the WorldMapButton when editing routes, then sets it back to its original parent when done.  This allows smoother movement of the route pins.  The original parent is a scroll frame with causes the pins to have issues when trying to be moved. -Pulling in updated LibMapData-1.0 files.

	- - Fixed Patch 6.0.2 bugs due to changes in GetMapContinents and GetMapZones. - Updated LibMapData-1.0's repository to fix the same bug, so this should repackage the updated library.
