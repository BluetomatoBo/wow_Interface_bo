## Changed in v6

* Added rares to all zones, because I got tired of people complaining and it's not like I don't have the dataset available from [SilverDragon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/WoW/silver-dragon).

* Made grapple point icon more visible.

## Changed in v5

* Change the item-icon setting default to false, and have it affect achievement icons and currency icons as well. Makes for a more legible map, on the whole.

* Separate nodes added for cave entrances / grapple points leading to treasures.
* Fixes in Stormheim.

## Changed in v4

* Fixed Demon Hunter starting vault treasures to only display on the correct floors.

## Changed in v2

## Changed in v1

* Initial dataset: limited coverage of all Legion zones.
* Special handling for artifact-power as a fake currency, rather than just adding in a random power item.

## Changed in v0.1

* Initial framework for display.
