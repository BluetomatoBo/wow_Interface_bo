--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Automatically clear old values in the FogClear Data
	This avoids issues of old and misplaced textures being rendered after a
	major zone re-design.
	- Simplify previous commit
	- Fix scale of the new continent/zone dropdowns
	- Use secure hooks for the dropdown scale fix
	- Completely replace continent/zone dropdowns instead of hooking them
	This should avoid a few taint issues.
	- Fix another case of quest/digsite blobs being shown in the wrong position
	- Add Siege of Orgrimmar instance map
	- Ensure the map isn't locked
