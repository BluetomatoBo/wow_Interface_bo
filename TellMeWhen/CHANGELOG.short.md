## v8.6.8
* Re-releasing TellMeWhen for Retail WoW as 8.6.8 so it will be the latest file for people with out-of-date Twitch apps.
 * IMPORTANT: If your Twitch app was installing TellMeWhen Classic into your Retail WoW installation, that means your Twitch app is out of date and needs to be updated.
 * To update your Twitch app, open the menu in the top-left corner of the app and choose "Check for Updates" under the "Help" menu.
