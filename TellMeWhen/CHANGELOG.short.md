## v8.7.0
* The Missing Buffs/Debuffs icon type now sorts by lowest duration first.
* Switched to DRList-1.0 (from DRData-1.0) for DR category data.
* Added events to the Combat Event icon type for swing & spell dodges/blocks/parries.
* Added an option to Spell Cooldown icons and Cooldown conditions to prevent the GCD from being ignored.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed an uncommon issue that could cause some event-driven icons to not update correctly after one of the units being tracked by an icon stops existing.
