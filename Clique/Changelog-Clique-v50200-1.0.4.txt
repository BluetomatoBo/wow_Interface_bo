Tagging v50200-1.0.4


--------------------

James Whitehead II:
	- Temporarily fix an issue with unit menus
	After 5.2 when Blizzard switched to 'togglemenu', there is a bug with
	the dropdown code that requires raid frames to continue using 'menu'
	instead in order to work properly. This change should properly use the
	correct attribute until this bug has been fixed.
