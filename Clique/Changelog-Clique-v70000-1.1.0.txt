Tagging v70000-1.1.0


--------------------

Jim Whitehead:
	- Add support for automatically switching profiles on talent change
	These different profiles can be configured on the general options
	screen.
	- Update localization
	- Add support for new talent specializations
	This new version works a bit differently than the old one in that the
	same spell can be bound to multiple talent sets and it should work
	correctly. Basically if a talent bind set is selected then the bind will
	only be available when that spec is active, but it is no longer an ONLY
	bind set.
