Jim Whitehead:
	- Attempt to resolve the issue with "stuck" bindings
	There are some situations in which the mouseover unit can go away, and
	we're currently using this to detect if a frame might be obscuring the
	current one or if the current frame has been hidden.
	
	I have made this check smarter and it should be better at determining
	when to clear the bindings that have been set. If you want to view more
	information about when bindings are being clear (or not) you can run the
	following in-game:
	
	/run Clique.settings.debugUnitIssue = true
	/reload
	
	You can remove these messages later with the reverse:
	
	/run Clique.settings.debugUnitIssue = false
	/reload
