Tagging v70100-1.0.0


--------------------

Jim Whitehead:
	- Ensure we don't try to register nameplates
	- Update for 7.1
	- Fire bindings changed on player entering world
	Some spec-based bindings are being lost in between instances, this
	should help to mitigate that. It's difficult to reproduce without the
	right character/instance which I'm not able to reproduce but this should
	fix some of those issues.
	
	It will cause Clique to do a slight bit more work when zoning between
	instances, but I don't think there are any crucial points where that
	happens.
