Tagging v50100-1.0.0


--------------------

James Whitehead II:
	- Update TOC for 5.1
	- Fix option for disabling target of target frame
	Fixes 82
	- Fix bindings for spells needing AOE targeting
	The 'stop casting fix' was being applied to global bindings in addition
	to hovercast bindings, which was breaking spells like Hurricane and
	Blizzard. This should resolve those issues.
	- Don't apply wrong-spec bindings
	Previously, if you were in your primary spec and you had a spell that
	was bound to secondary spec only, the binding would still be active
	(although it would not do anything). Simple test:
	
	  1. Bind 'moonfire' to 1 on hovercast,secspec
	  2. Verify it works
	  3. Change to primary spec
	  4. You will be unable to use your '1' normal binding
