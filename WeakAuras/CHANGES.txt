    Fix Animations resetting Color set via Conditions
    
    Similar idea as the previous commit.
    
    Introduce two properties, Color and ColorAnim.
    
    ColorAnim overrides Color if set. In the Animation set ColorAnim.
    Resetting a Color animation is thus just calling ColorAnim with nil.
    
    This kind of override/combination of properties between animations
    and conditons should ideally be handled centrally instead of how
    this patch implements it. This can be cleaned up at a later point.

    Fix interaction between animations and anchoring
    
    The animations used to save the position/anchor on start and
    restored those on finishing the animation. Even if the animation
    didn't actually touch the position.
    
    This can clash with Anchoring, as there the anchor might not be
    immediately available and thus set a bit later.
    
    Fix that, by adding 3 different orthogonal properties to regions
    via RegionProperties:
    
    - SetAnchor, which sets the anchorFrame and the anchorPoints
    - SetOffset, which sets a offset
    - SetOffsetAnim, which sets a extra offset for animations
    
    Thus, if a animation ends, all it has to do is SetOffsetAnim to 0,0.
    
    That also means that we could add a xOffset/yOffset to the conditions
    now.
    
    This is slightly backwards incompatible for custom translate functions,
    they no longer get the "real" offset but the "animation" offset passed
    in. And they should no longer return the "complete" offset, but the
    animation offset.
    
    Keep the old code in the animtions for the tray animation. Those still
    work as before. There seems to be a bit of wonkyness with those, but
    that seems to match what they did before.
