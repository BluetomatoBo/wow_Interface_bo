Tagging as v1.2.2.


--------------------

Ethan Centaurai:
	- Added control-rightclick to set waypoints to every unvisited candy bucket.
	- Removed pointless dropdown menu. Waypoints now only require one click!
	- Trim trailing whitespace.
	- Delay collecting the list of completed quests until the last possible minute.
	- Polite reminder that your installed copy of HandyNotes may be out of date, causing this plug-in to not work as expected.
