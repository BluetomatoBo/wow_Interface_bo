	- _NPCScan.Overlay: No longer depends on _NPCScan to load, and can run standalone.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Added a new "NpcOverlay_RegisterScanner" message allowing NPC scanning mods to assume control of which paths are shown.  The first scanning mod to register gains sole access.  All other messages (Add/Remove/Found) now require a second parameter, an addon identifier, that must match the identifier given in the register message.

	- _NPCScan.Overlay: The Minimap's found ring now rotates when minimap rotation is enabled.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Changed the way the BattlefieldMinimap module is anchored so that it accurately overlays the map tiles.  Also seems to resolve compatibility issues with Capping's narrow map feature.

	* Now always fills circular segments with lots of tris instead of using circular textures, so that rendering the areas is still concentrated at the end of the main paint function.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Initial commit of CanvasClip round clipping algorithm.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Minimap clipping algorithm no longer attempts to draw collinear or concurrent triangle vertices.

	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Moved canvas modules to a Modules folder.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Added Carbonite support.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Minimap clipping now renders split points:
	* Texture creation and path removal systems simplified.
	* PathData is now used as an argument to draw functions rather than an NpcID.
	* TextureAdd now only creates a texture if its dimensions are valid.
	* Added a CanvasClip tool that simulates minimap shapes and the clipping algorithm.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Added boundaries to SetTexCoord parameters to prevent "out of range" errors.
	- Merged 30200 branch into trunk.
	- _NPCScan.Overlay: Added all Outlands rare paths.  Tri texcoords now account for the one-pixel transparent border around the triangle image.  Also added miscellaneous helper files to a "Tools" folder not intended for distribution.
