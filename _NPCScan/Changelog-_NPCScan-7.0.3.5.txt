--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Added detection of new Legion vignetteID.
	- Use HereBeDragons for grabbing the correct continent ID, instead of Broken Isles, during PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD so detection will work again for Tanaan. Tightened up some logic for continent ID -1.
	- Add Broken Isles.
	- Formatting fixes.
	- Remove TANAAN_JUNGLE2, whatever the hell that was supposed to be. Wasn't used anywhere.
	- Remove all unnecessary Debug calls. Minor cleanup for VIGNETTE_ADDED.
	- Corrected spelling for two method names - "avtivate" versus "activate".
