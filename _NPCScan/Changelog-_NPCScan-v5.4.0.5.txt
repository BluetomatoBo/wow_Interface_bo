Tagging changes as v5.4.0.5


--------------------

SLOKnightfall:
	- removed Vern from alert list per user requests
	- Fix to NPCScan.AutoAdd check Fix to remove non tamable Timeless Isle beasts from tamable list
James D. Callahan III:
	- Moved (and renamed) some constants to their own file and added a few which facilitated the removal of hardcoded numbers.
SLOKnightfall:
	- added version check to the _NPCScan.AutoAdd warning so it will only appear on incompatible versions.
James D. Callahan III:
	- Ticket #22: Added six NPC IDs to NPC_FACTION
Oscarucb:
	- ticket 21: impl. proper DB upgrade for custom list
	Now on database upgrade (after installing an updated addon version)
	we try very hard to preserve the previous custom list of NPCs entered
	by the user. This won't help users who already had their settings wiped
	by addon v5.2 - 5.4, but will prevent future wipes on users upgrading
	from older versions, or when the DB_VERSION next changes.
James D. Callahan III:
	- Minor changes.
	- Disable manual change log until a new Release version.
	- Reformatting, removal of unnecessary parens and killing of the semicolons. Amen.
	- Restructuring, variable-name changes, and comment changes/removals.
	- Replace hardcoded ID with a constant.
	- More logical grouping - Achievements.
	- More logical grouping.
	- Variable-name changes.
