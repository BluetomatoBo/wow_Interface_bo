--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Attempt to ensure behavioral consistency between all detection types.
	- Rewrite of macro-targeting code.
	- Rewrite of the completely batshit mouseover detection code. Now less WAT, and isn't restricted to "rare" or "rareelite" - custom-entered NPC IDs will now work.
	- Dead code removal. This shit has been commented out for two years; NPC cacheing isn't coming back...
	- Don't detect dead NPCs via nameplate...
	- UnitGUIDToCreatureID => UnitTokenToCreatureID
	- Nuke the 3D model camera adjustment code. Commenting while using a VCS is just silly.
	- Just comment out the 3D model scaling for now. I'm not even sure I want to keep that frame, since so many people complain about it.
	- Add new nameplate-scanning code.
	- Nuke Nameplates.lua and get rid of LibNameplateRegistry-1.0 since the new code I'm about to write won't need it.
	- Cleanups. Because WAT.
	- Bump ToC Interface version to 70000.
