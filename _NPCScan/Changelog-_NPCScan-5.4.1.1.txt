--------------------

James D. Callahan III:
	- Added LibTextDump-1.0 to .pkgmeta and the ToC.
	- ...followup commit to make it actually work...
	- Committing the code for dumping NPC_DATA in case it's needed again.
	- Set LibTextDump-1.0 as an OptionalDep
	- Added a unified table of world IDs, map names, and tamable status from which the other tables will be build; having this data in a single location makes wrong or missing data easier to see.
	- Updated private.RareMobData.NPCWorldIDs to use the zone name constants rather than English strings.
	- Added Hawkbane to list of tamable beasts.
	- Have GeneralNPCUpdate() handle map IDs as well as names until private.TamableIDs is updated to use names.
	- Use the zone name constants instead of locally-defined versions.
	- Renamed private.RareMobData.NPCMapIDs to private.RareMobData.map_names and switched to using the zone name constants.
	- Added name constants for both zones and continents.
	- Removed unused RareMobData.NPCs table.
	- Load Constants.lua before NPCData.lua
	- Reformat, kill semi-colons.
	- Dead code removal.
