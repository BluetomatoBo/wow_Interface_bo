--------------------

SLOKnightfall:
	- Moved stored_options & stored_character_options to old positions.  When they were moved in alpha 4-g804e167, they were getting set after the main option table had been reset to the defaults, resulting in loss of the user's settings.
James D. Callahan III:
	- Fixed ticket #59
	- Use LibDialog-1.0 instead of StaticPopup.
	- Cleanups/clarifications.
	- More target icon code cleanups. Use NUM_RAID_ICONS instead of hardcoded value of 8.
	- Formatting/whitespace cleanup. Removed unnecessary comments and an errant else block.
	- Cleaned up icon dropdown code.
