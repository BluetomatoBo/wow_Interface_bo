# Deadly Boss Mods Core

## [8.2.28](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/tree/8.2.28) (2019-11-14)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/compare/8.2.27...8.2.28)

- Version increase without update notification activation. This release is purely for this weeks ptr, so while it is version 8.2.28, it will not send update notification to 8.2.27 users.  
- Update Nzoth again. The journal update posted by wowhead was from an obsolete build and some mechanics were missed. Thanks to Reloe for pointing this out.  
- Some pre mythic testing tweaks to vexiona and maut. Wrathion already looks fine  
- Tweaks to cataclysm and wrath events  
    Revised update policy to return to DBM force disabling if more than 1 month out of date, instead of only doing force disables on major patches. When out of date mods are wiping raids REPEATEDLY, DBM is being too leaniant. In addition, the update notification nag message can no longer be disabled either. Out of date, get a nag, period.  
- Full Nzoth drycode based on current build. quite a few guesses based on incomplete journal and 0 phase change code exists so timers will auto generate during phases but not between phase changes.  
    Fixed bug where charged bonds was missing voice on Rad-den  
    Additional tweaks to timer scheduling on Shadhar  
- Several Nyalotha fixes/additions based on more normal mode feedback.
