	- Omega via svn r15361: Ilgynoth tweaks. these variable timers blow
	- Omega via svn r15360: Update to revent errors with the complete removal of GetPlayerFacing in 7.1. Not sure what their design intent is yet for out in world so haven?\226?\128?\153t deleted arrow YET. This will just make it quietly not work.
	- Omega via svn r15359: Heroic and normal/LFR timers on ilgynoth do NOT match. create different tables for each. Count spawns in messages restrict ooze marking to mythic only Fix icon marking for cenarius. Extend time it scans and make it actually scan more than one mob (bad usage of break fixed in core) Drycode phase 3 orbs on helya so at least something is there.
	- Omega via svn r15358: Fix befoulment yell

	- Omega via svn r15349: Add general alert stack counter to overwhelm Change range frame on cenarius to always show if sisters are up period, instead of only when player has debuff. It?\226?\128?\153ll continue to show if player has debuff when sisters die.

	- Omega via svn r15340: Do not send timers if RT is sent by a person not in raid, to prevent it from being abused as a means to query fight status without users permission.
	- Omega via svn r15339: Cenarius Update Added stomp timer Added scorned touch timer Added initial add timers Added wisp icon marking (off by default) Changed stack count to start warning earlier
	This all should have been done a week ago, when Ketsuki requested it. blame Matthew!
	- Omega via svn r15338: Update tentacle timers per hotfix notes
	- Omega via svn r15337: Change spellid used for crushing grip description so it?\226?\128?\153s more descriptive. Changed yell to say ?\226?\128?\156throw?\226?\128?\157 instead to be more clear.
