Tagging as 6.2.13


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.2.13
	- Omega via svn r14606: make it still work on world bosses though.
	- Omega via svn r14605: Better yell debug, so it works in most 5 mans and older raids
	- Omega via svn r14604: Fix shackled torment hud bug i introduced in last update
	- Omega via svn r14603: Remove deepholm from that
	- Omega via svn r14602: TW Cataclysm prep
	- Omega via svn r14601: *CN update *Fix bug on xhul where it?\226?\128?\153d detect wrong tank (on who took strike) if the taunt was last second. This was do to an erronious way blizzard reports cast success (it reports success for wrong target. even if he changes targets mid cast, success fired for the original target not the one it actually hit. FORTUNATELy there was a second success spellid that differs that returns the real target to fix this). This should fix any remaining imperfections with the warnings. *Fixed missing countdown for first annihilating strike on Velhari ##Optimized countdown object to not need to constantly look up path/count form a table every time a countdown starts. This will now only be done at login or if a voice (any of 3) are changed.
	- Omega via svn r14600: *CN update *Fix bug on xhul where it?\226?\128?\153d detect wrong tank (on who took strike) if the taunt was last second. This was do to an erronious way blizzard reports cast success (it reports success for wrong target. even if he changes targets mid cast, success fired for the original target not the one it actually hit. FORTUNATELy there was a second success spellid that differs that returns the real target to fix this). This should fix any remaining imperfections with the warnings. *Fixed missing countdown for first annihilating strike on Velhari
	- Omega via svn r14599: Just some tweaks
	- nbluewiz via svn r14598: # koKR update.
	- ultrashining via svn r14597: zhTW fix
	- ultrashining via svn r14596: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r14595: #Mannoroth tweaks *Better player messages for doom, so they can get position from that too instead of looking at own yell to figure it out. This includes voice pack alert as well, which will say ?\226?\128?\156move to <mark>?\226?\128?\157 instead of ?\226?\128?\156run out?\226?\128?\157 on mythic difficulty. *Doom icons are now ON by default (but now disabled in LFR) #Archmonde Tweek *Mark of the legion now has voice pack support. This was a blatant oversight and I?\226?\128?\153m sorry for that. Not enough voice pack users to notice it earlier :\
	- Omega via svn r14594: Move edict to SUCCESS for timer. It can miss target if they just happened to have an immunity up when targeted.
	- Omega via svn r14593: Tweak a couple option defaults to be off by default on mannoroth. No one uses 2 tank strat anymore. Made the taunt warnings smarter for mannoroth himself to be smarter for the 3rd doom lord tank. Now if you are > 20 yards from mannoroth and number of tanks in raid is 3 or greater, it assumes this isn?\226?\128?\153t your job and ignores warning.
	- Omega via svn r14592: Add optional special warning for void fiends so an optional custom sound is available to people. Add a non special warning for imps in case it?\226?\128?\153s desired to only be aware they spawned but not have it stressed by a special warning.
	- Omega via svn r14591: add redundant taunt check for when xhul casts same strike twice in a row. Adjust delay on void scanner a little, it seemed to be warning previous target instead of current.
	- Omega via svn r14590: Some test code
	- Omega via svn r14589: change to rooted instead of ?\226?\128?\156root?\226?\128?\157 because it translates better in non english locals, even though it?\226?\128?\153s kinda worse in english :\.
	- Omega via svn r14588: Fix a bug where void alerts/warnings kept going after 20%
	- Omega via svn r14587: Show player dot even if you aren?\226?\128?\153t one of shackles
	- Omega via svn r14586: While at it, give that a voice pack warning
	- Omega via svn r14585: Bump HFRev
	- Omega via svn r14584: More efficient fix. Plus extra failsafe just in case
	- Omega via svn r14583: Fix void star fixate, which apparently has ALWAYS been broken on mythic (and yet no one reported it until now). guess since everyone uses weak aura?\226?\128?\153s over boss mods anyways. sigh.
	- Omega via svn r14582: Tweak for mythic
	- Omega via svn r14581: Fixed one voice pack filter on Koragh Added a Note to Phemos. I think the whirlwind sound should be renamed in 7.0 to ?\226?\128?\156whirlwind?\226?\128?\157. It?\226?\128?\153ll have more uses. This little note will just be a reminder to edit file name in this mod when that happens.
	- Omega via svn r14580: Apply other half, and do TW which was missed
	- tandanu via svn r14579: localization: prevent floating point weirdness when printing timers
	- Omega via svn r14578: Fire a dummy DBM_TimerStart callback for break and pull timers. Most args missing because it?\226?\128?\153d be too hackish to make those args up from nothing. It simply sends ?\226?\128?\156pull?\226?\128?\157 for an ID and timer text and timer value, none of extra stuff like spellid, etc.
	- Omega via svn r14577: More logic improvement to smart taunt code for xhul. Even if vanguard is dead, doesn?\226?\128?\153t mean the vanguard tank is safe to flip the taunt order whenever they want if omnus is still up on mythic
	- Omega via svn r14576: Make personal mark of legion warning more apparent(higher priority default)
	- Omega via svn r14575: Adjust iskar berserk I guess. Logs I had showed 8:30 for mythic, but some claim 8
	- Omega via svn r14574: Remove useless broken warning it hought i already removed long ago
	- ultrashining via svn r14573: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r14572: tweak
	- Omega via svn r14571: Put a check here too so that timer doesn?\226?\128?\153t activate in timer correction code
	- Omega via svn r14570: Apply timer changes related to sept 30th hotfixes Tweak some option defaults for tanks on gorefiend.
	- Omega via svn r14569: More optionversion hack removals Also try to optimize countdown object some.
	- Omega via svn r14568: Remove upvalues for PlaySoundFile and PlaySound. hopefully fid script ran too long errors from calling these (wtf?). Calling a blizzard function then having blizz complain function is too slow is silly.
	- tandanu via svn r14567: increment alpha version
