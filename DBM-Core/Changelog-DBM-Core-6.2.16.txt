	- Omega via svn r14709: Force hud on by default for mark of legion Change it to turn red if you walk into it so you know which ones you are in range of Show player dot as well This may be completely broken, if it is, sorry. It?\226?\128?\153s near impossible to test.

	- Omega via svn r14704: Make hudar match radar behavior of +0.5 buffer
	- Omega via svn r14703: move entire hud to worldframe instead of uiparent. This should make it work correctly with viewpoints. It needs testing to ensure no regressions though.

Numbered by default (matching BW), location based with melee left/right and ranged left/right that puts short debuffs in melee and long at ranged, and location based with melee left/right and ranged left/right that puts short debuffs in ranged and long in melee. Method used is chosen by raid leader and synced to raid for uniformity. If no sync from raid leader is sent then it always defaults to numbered, on assumption RL is using BW.
	- Omega via svn r14690: Use SetFromAlpha/SetToAlpha like blizzard does, since they removed SetChange in legion
	- Omega via svn r14689: Possibly fix issues where users don?\226?\128?\153t see wipe messages

	- Omega via svn r14684: and fix bug with countdown while at it
	- Omega via svn r14683: Been meaning to fix this for week. fixed logic code in grim rail enforcers where the more rapid flaming slash timer was only applied to heroic but not mythic or CM difficulty. the slow timer should be normal only.

	- Omega via svn r14676: Fix another case of glad stance nil in 7.0
