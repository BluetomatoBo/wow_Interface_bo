Tagging as 6.2.12


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.2.12
	- Omega via svn r14565: Some tweaks
	- Omega via svn r14564: Further improve voice pack warnings for xhul Disable black hole timer for tanks by default to further reduce timers tanks receive by default.
	- Omega via svn r14563: Add some smart taunt code to xhul that should fairly accurately detect which add is on you and appropriately warn which strikes you should taunt xhul for based on what add you are currently tanking. it obviously won?\226?\128?\153t work correctly if you are tanking both adds. However if you are tanking both adds then pretty safe bet things have gone wrong already. :). As fallback code, if you are tanking no add, then it simply will fall back to warning you to taunt next strike if the previous strike hit the other tank.
	- Omega via svn r14562: Fr update. may have errors
	- Omega via svn r14561: Check if BW is present and if not, register ?\226?\128?\156pull?\226?\128?\157 and ?\226?\128?\156break?\226?\128?\157 as independent slash commands
	- ebmor via svn r14560: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r14559: Tweak another timer to start on success instead of start. Add voice alert for shadowfel phasing.

	- Omega via svn r14556: Add most common brewfest npc of them all to try to improve auto loading
	- Omega via svn r14555: *Fix a bug on velhari where the sovereign warning would fire more than once. *Made a few changes on xhul to SUCCESS instead of START to prevent timers from inefficiently restarting for no reason (it didn?\226?\128?\153t cause timer accuracy errors, just triggered needless timer restarts if boss switched targets do to death or feigns. *prevent purple mode stuff from firing on mythic since it was, again, just inefficient timer restarting for no reason. *Changed surge timers to be OFF by default for tanks, to reduce bar clutter for them. *Very miner timer adjusts of 1 sec here and there.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r14554: ruRU update
	- TOM_RUS via svn r14553: ruRU update
