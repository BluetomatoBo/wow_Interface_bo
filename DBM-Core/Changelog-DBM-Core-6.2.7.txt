Tagging as 6.2.7


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.2.7
	- ultrashining via svn r14306: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r14305: Add icon marking to gaze on mannoroth. I didn?\226?\128?\153t realize this was never added. Off by default.
	- nbluewiz via svn r14304: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r14303: #Hellfire Council *Show range frame for reap #Velhari Update *Improve rangeframe for font of corruption *Only show phase 1 range frame during temptest instead of all the time.
	- Omega via svn r14302: Re-enable artillery range frame in phase 1 for MELEE
	- Omega via svn r14301: Improve the localizeers needed message
	- Omega via svn r14300: Help message
	- Omega via svn r14299: What?\226?\128?\153s new
	- Omega via svn r14298: More voice pack improvements
	- Omega via svn r14297: forgot setDarkConduit on FIRST dark conduit. fixed!
	- Omega via svn r14296: *Improve dark conduit a bit with a pre warning for ranged and auto opening radar to 8 yards 8 seconds before cast, and auto closing it 3 seconds after 3rd conduit has spawned. *Changed actual spawn warnings to regular alert instead of special warning, and count the 3 spawns so ranged know when all 3 are out and it?\226?\128?\153s safe to once again group. *Improved voice back alerts a little (more work to do on those but i wanted to push ranged update right away)
	- Omega via svn r14295: refactor tank abilities on kormrok to use scheduling instead of cast triggers, this way the timers still work if the attacks are skipped by outranging them. Calculated approximate timers for mythic enraged phases no one ever sees, so timers work for the day mag or someone solos this boss in 7.0 and needs them.
	- Omega via svn r14294: Enable auto icon marking on mythic infernals too
	- Omega via svn r14293: Put this here for now. I guess arg order doesn?\226?\128?\153t have to change in these locals. The icon just won?\226?\128?\153t be on both sides of player names. It?\226?\128?\153ll be oddly placed at end but still workable
	- ultrashining via svn r14292: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r14291: Reduce yellFocusedChaos some, plus fix a bug with two showing at start
	- Omega via svn r14290: Source of chaos failsafe, in case it?\226?\128?\153s exploited. Added countdown for source of chaos and seething corruption while at it. changed dark conduit timer to off by default for melee.
	- Omega via svn r14289: another tweak
	- Omega via svn r14288: Remove unused global
	- Omega via svn r14287: Put icons around player name in 1 locals, add notes to 3 others.
	- Omega via svn r14286: Few HF revision bumps
	- TOM_RUS via svn r14285: ruRU update
	- Omega via svn r14284: Make DontShowUserTimers apply to pull and break functions as a whole
	- Omega via svn r14283: line should be 50, but it?\226?\128?\153s god damn ugly at 50 so making it smaller anyways
	- Omega via svn r14282: Small timer update
	- Omega via svn r14281: Fixes to last
	- Omega via svn r14280: Cleanup yell text so yell options say what TYPE of yell it is. especially important for a mod like archimond that has two yell options for SAME spell This requires a lot of localizing updates though :\ Fulfil guild request to add raid icons to position yells per example in Pwnanza vs archimond kill video Update radar for mark of legion on PLAYER to be red unless 4 other players are in range, then turn green (reverse radar) Cleaned up mark code to reduce redundancy and improve notation on it in case any one wants to make compatible yell for mark

	- Omega via svn r14212: Tweak
	- Omega via svn r14211: Shorten prefix for all addmsg events. long prefix too often causes unnecessary line breaks and makes messages harder to read. ##Split help commands up more. people don?\226?\128?\153t like to scroll up to read them. This will require a lot of localized updates!
	- Omega via svn r14210: Add reset button for info/range frames
	- Omega via svn r14209: disable ValidateFramePosition for now on infoframe and range frame. It blocks custom UIs from putting frames where action bar usually is, even if action bar is no longer there.

	- TOM_RUS via svn r14203: Test stuff
	- Omega via svn r14202: Tweaks to last
	- Omega via svn r14201: Use edge/arrow for shared fate

	- Omega via svn r14199: Change how font debuff does countdown
	- Omega via svn r14198: Boss health updates. Apparently people still use this
	- Omega via svn r14197: cast down timer tweak
	- Omega via svn r14196: Fix first soul vessel timer
	- Omega via svn r14195: Update shackled torment hud, now it will always be red if ANYONE OTHER than source is in it, green if it?\226?\128?\153s safe to break torment. can?\226?\128?\153t get any easier then that!
	- Omega via svn r14194: Tweaks to shackle torment Throttle reap alerts on mark jumps.

	- Omega via svn r14186: Add GTFO for Fel laser fire
	- Omega via svn r14185: Added timer for mirror image phase duration Added corrective timer code for the way reap works on pull. reap is either 50 seconds, or 65-67. So now I start a 50 second timer, but if it?\226?\128?\153s not cast at 50 seconds, start a secondary timer for 65 second cast. Why this variation happens is a mystery. MOST of time it?\226?\128?\153s 65-67, but I refuse to code a timer thats ?\226?\128?\156most of the time?\226?\128?\157 when every once in a while it is 50. Added counter to vissage cast Clean up redundant yell
	- Omega via svn r14184: Enable force, for testing
	- Omega via svn r14183: Add two new countdowns to velhari
	- Omega via svn r14182: Fix another bug with interrupt missing target name
	- Omega via svn r14181: Fix bug with iskar timers never resuming after shadow escape
	- Omega via svn r14180: Fix it so wroughtWarned variable stays correct for phased players (nether) Still show who you are connected to on mythic
	- Omega via svn r14179: Lower range frame on velhari just a little Hide range frame on archimond when in nether realm (non mythic). demonic feedback doesn?\226?\128?\153t occur down there. It?\226?\128?\153ll re-show automatically on existing if needed.
	- Omega via svn r14178: #Archimond Update *Set icon son felburst targets *Assign fel burst targets with numbered yells *Show fel burst targets on infoframe as well for extra visual *Don?\226?\128?\153t show felburst hud by default, let it be toggled on if desired.
	- Omega via svn r14177: Icon mark off by default on archimond. apparently exrt decided to do it?\226?\128?\153s own raid marking that was a complete clusterfuck conflict. Better to just disable mine since many will be using exrt Extend lines on iskar by 1 second
	- Omega via svn r14176: Fix lua error in velhari
	- Omega via svn r14175: Change harbrigers mending to UNIT_SPELLCAST_START since it no longer is in combat log (wtf?)
	- Omega via svn r14174: Iskar lines worked good, minus the fact i only checked if player was melee, melee or melee so the green line didn?\226?\128?\153t show if tank or ranged. oops :) Try yellow lines for non personal, cause red ones were difficult to see.
	- Omega via svn r14173: Fix error
	- Omega via svn r14172: Chakram hud Fix bug in mark of the legion on archimond
	- Omega via svn r14171: Make own players dot also more visible
