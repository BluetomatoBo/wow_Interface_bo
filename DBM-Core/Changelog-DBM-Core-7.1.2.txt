	- Omega via svn r15433: This should probably fix issues with Mythic+ Timer not hiding. I realize now what?\226?\128?\153s happening is players already have a mod hiding objectives frame or replacing it, so frame is already returning false for visible, but dbm only canceled mythic+ if DBM is the mod that was hiding watch frame.
