--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.2.8
	- Omega via svn r14339: Fix some minor LFR bugs Fel Rage timers were reverted. they seem to be the way they were before august 11th hotfix
	- Omega via svn r14338: Fixed some stupid Fixed some numpty
	- Omega via svn r14337: better shared fate hud code. Use edgeto on existing points instead of different points with Addedge. This should resolve issue where one of shared fate players dies and line gets stuck behind when point is removed. Also fixed minor inefficiencies in it (such as creating rooted player point 3x)
	- Omega via svn r14336: Actually revert that. It?\226?\128?\153s not actually needed, that was just overthinking things.
	- Omega via svn r14335: Fix
	- Omega via svn r14334: CN update
	- Omega via svn r14333: Some color bar tweaks Fix duplicate entries added to infoframe for wrath of guldan
	- Omega via svn r14332: CN update
	- Omega via svn r14331: Fix regressions in shared fate warning Fix some bugs with archimond hud that?\226?\128?\153d cause names/dots to disappear prematurely
	- Omega via svn r14330: Fix lua error try to fix timer animation bug with updates
	- Omega via svn r14329: Improve fel rage timers too after log scouring. Best log was https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/1Aznpyht3MJP7Yv8#fight=7&pins=2%24Off%24%23244F4B%24expression%24ability.id+%3D+184360+and+type+%3D+%22applydebuff%22&view=events
	- Omega via svn r14328: Fix mannoorth lua error
	- Omega via svn r14327: Experimental timer extender for reap getting delayed by visage. It?\226?\128?\153s important to be more accurate than assumptions other boss mods make. this IS a 54 second cd that sometimes happens AFTER 54 seconds. the fact that most of time it?\226?\128?\153s 64+, is the result of a delay and not in fact a 64 second cd. This includes the rare cases reap is 50 seconds after engage instead of 68 (also a visage delay)
	- ultrashining via svn r14326: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r14325: Hopefully fix lua error with world bosses that don?\226?\128?\153t have questid but use combat_yell
	- Omega via svn r14324: Detect when wrought chaos delays shackled torment and automatically update timer/countdown.
	- Omega via svn r14323: Some kazzak fixes
	- Omega via svn r14322: Fixes to dungeon check code
	- Omega via svn r14321: Update reap for August 11th hotfix
	- Omega via svn r14320: Code tweaks
	- Omega via svn r14319: Just use a hard coded timer for phase 3 infernals, instead of table. only the other phases seem to have variable times. Add wrath of guldan to radar function Added more protections against players leaving the raid causing nil errors in infoframe.
	- Omega via svn r14318: Add nil checks in case someone ninja leaves raid mid pull. cause this happens apparently.
	- Omega via svn r14317: chang default
	- Omega via svn r14316: wording
	- Omega via svn r14315: More fixes/improvements to last
	- Omega via svn r14314: Fix missing timer options It?\226?\128?\153ll reset defaults though. Add option to show only player lines for shared fate.
	- Omega via svn r14313: Add disable for this, because people are going to ask for it
	- Omega via svn r14312: bwversion
	- Omega via svn r14311: Fix regression from last
	- Omega via svn r14310: Make the shackled torment code more robust, it should no longer error on a wipe if there are less than 3 shackled torment targets on mythic Fix countdown bug on mannoroth
	- Omega via svn r14309: All timers now fully verified by very long logs. I?\226?\128?\153m pretty good at video timers. Was able to get a mark of legion cast beyond method kill video too. Fixed infernal marking for 6th set (which has 5)
	- Omega via svn r14308: Inc Alpha
