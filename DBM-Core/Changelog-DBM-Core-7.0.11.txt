--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 7.0.11
	- Omega via svn r15307: And give it a countdown option
	- Omega via svn r15306: Shorten first nightmare blast by 0.7
	- Omega via svn r15305: Added auto icon options for Renferal web of pain. Star and circle on tanks. Triangle and diamond on non tanks. Improved personal and general announces for web of pain to better describe who?\226?\128?\153s linked to who. Added Arrow/Hud Options for Web of Pain (highly configurable)
	- Omega via svn r15304: Fix spam
	- Omega via svn r15303: Add befoulement to trash. Still need to review what interrupts it. Add infesting breath timer (always 10 seconds after breath) Improve personal warnings for it
	- Omega via svn r15302: Add warnings to the first boss of emerald nightmare. Gelatinized Decay Add audio countdown to rot expiring Add rot faded warning to rot fading. Fixed volatile rot countdown so it actually counts down (if enabled)
	- Omega via svn r15301: Tank filter this, even though it?\226?\128?\153s already literally impossible to warn for non tanks (since I don?\226?\128?\153t use non tanks pellId). I have numerous reports from suers who say dbm is warning for a spellID that?\226?\128?\153s not in mod anyways. SO now it?\226?\128?\153s impossible x 2
