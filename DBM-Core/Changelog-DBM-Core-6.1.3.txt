Tagging as 6.1.3


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.1.3
	- Omega via svn r13418: Make filter off by default. not all strats revolve around person standing in place and ignore it.
	- Omega via svn r13417: Fix one error
	- Omega via svn r13416: Reduce timer debug spam on blackhand. no other issues though. LFR was fine (mod wise)
	- nbluewiz via svn r13415: # fix mythic first mfd cd.
	- Omega via svn r13414: Change 1 hansgar timer to not report false debug. no actual user change though, timer was fine.
	- Omega via svn r13413: actually revert slag part. that?\226?\128?\153ll probably confuse too many. MFD is still good on normal/heroic cause that?\226?\128?\153s universal
	- Omega via svn r13412: Enable that in normal and heroic too
	- Omega via svn r13411: #Blackhand Update *Update slag bomb yells to work with BW helper (now working) melee check
	- Omega via svn r13410: #Blackhand Update *Use fancy yells only in phase 3, regular in phase 1-2. *Enable fancy yells in normal and heroic as well during phase 3 (minus middle)
	- Omega via svn r13409: Add special warning for convulsive shadows too, but only on target scan, because it?\226?\128?\153ll be spammy if spreads were announced in special warnings.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13408: # little cd adjust.
	- Omega via svn r13407: Add note, so it?\226?\128?\153s kept handy
	- Omega via svn r13406: Even more fixes
	- Omega via svn r13405: Iron Maidens Update: *Verified on heroic logs, reset happens in all modes. only difference from mythic is the canceling of blood ritual and blade dash.
	- Omega via svn r13404: Iron Maidens Update: *Remove sync from ship. it actually caused more problems than it fixed. localized npc name being synced is pretty useless. This also fixes a bug where ship warnings would fail if first sync was not your own language *Fix first penetrating shot after a boat as well. I?\226?\128?\153m starting to wonder if any timer recovery is useful, because at least 4 of abilities reset on boat end and confirmed in many logs. just need to confirm heartseeker and shadows. *Also, apply same fix to blade dash target. One user reports that wrong blade dash was announced if convulsive was cast immediately before.
	- Omega via svn r13403: Iron Maidens Update: *Fixed first rapid fire after any boat phase has ended on mythic. *Changed alpha bombs to regular warning. Many complaints that double special warning was overkill, that special warning only should be omega. *Small adjust on convulsive shadows. Saw 0.5 restart message almost every cast. *Fix rare case where convulsive target scanner announces dash target, if convulsive comes immediately after blade dash (same bug as when bile came after acid torrent on oregorger)
	- ultrashining via svn r13402: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r13401: fix
	- Omega via svn r13400: Quick changes on break, untested
	- Omega via svn r13399: Deploy turret using wrong sound/priority, fix this. Also, send only ranged dps, not all dps. melee can?\226?\128?\153t get close without taking too much damage
	- Omega via svn r13398: Ambiguate sender name on kromog, and filter non promoted
	- Omega via svn r13397: CN update Update iron maidens filter to apply to ranged only. Melee generally have to run out every time and don?\226?\128?\153t get to stand in one place without moving.
	- Omega via svn r13396: Fix thousands of lua errors. new i should hav reviewed more
	- Omega via svn r13395: #RangeFrame *Calculate sin and cos rotation 1x each per update, instead of 40-60x each, per update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13394: # info frame for bomb and fixate.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13393: # add one more gtfo in darmac.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13392: # fix first falling debris.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13391: # fix self bomb timer in thogar.
	- tandanu via svn r13390: fix scheduled functions with too many nil values at the wrong positions :/
	- Omega via svn r13389: Fix a mistake. actually fix train 34
	- nbluewiz via svn r13388: # koKR update.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13387: # re-add target filter for grenade. # little adjust epicenter cd.
	- ultrashining via svn r13386: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r13385: # fix mythic 35 train.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13384: # re-added tankFilter. temporary fix.
	- Omega via svn r13383: fix darmac target scanner
	- Omega via svn r13382: Further robust, if exceed table limit, drop group count and just use slice count.
	- Omega via svn r13381: fix 2 group strat
	- Omega via svn r13380: Make infernoslice counter go up to 12 slices for mythic, in case some are not soaked by enough. so table doesn?\226?\128?\153t nil error
	- Omega via svn r13379: BWrevision
	- Omega via svn r13378: Move countformat to better place, to be more efficient. instead of setting it 3x
	- Omega via svn r13377: remaining coords for thogar and enable final markers
	- Omega via svn r13376: Revert scheduler regressions that caused massive issues. remove tank filter from bosstargetscanner for good. and just filter it in mods.
	- Omega via svn r13375: Fix double marked for death counting
	- nbluewiz via svn r13374: # MFD warning fix.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13373: # fix blood ritual count.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13372: # fix error in Blood Ritual warning.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13371: # fix scheduler canceling error.
	- Omega via svn r13370: Fix a few cases of args in wrong order on various NewTargetCountAnnounce warnings Make special warning match same arg order/format to keep things consistent Changed to string to better support custom numbering formats. Added secondary count to blackhand so that it?\226?\128?\153s possible to track both simultaneously in phase 2
	- nbluewiz via svn r13369: # correct fix for scanner.
	- Omega via svn r13368: #Thogar Update *A lot more work on the thogar helper *Fix bug that caused HEAVY spam from dispel warning
	- Omega via svn r13367: Fix tank ignore.
	- Omega via svn r13366: Didn?\226?\128?\153t mean to commit that half done with the Iron Maidens commits, but here is rest of Blackhand stuff per https://twitter.com/Mini_Dragon_CN/status/577229097799057408 and other user requests. Also made some changes to it to match BW helper mod to ensure no conflict in mixed mod raids.
	- Omega via svn r13365: More Iron Maidens Updates: *Disable fixate by default, it?\226?\128?\153s a spammy mess, even with antispam that is also added *Blade Dash and blood ritual now count, resetting on boat phases *Better timer defaults for bladedash so it?\226?\128?\153s not off by default for tanks. in fact this timer is MANDATORY for tanks on mythic. *Make timers for blade dash and blood ritual work perfectly on mythic in relation to boats.
	- Omega via svn r13364: More fixes
	- Omega via svn r13363: fix bug
	- Omega via svn r13362: CN update
	- Omega via svn r13361: add blade dash countdown
	- Omega via svn r13360: Try again to fix thogar constantly reporting tank as target
	- Omega via svn r13359: #Blackhand Update: *Only reset marked for death count on phase changes *Remove hackery that is a bit pointless, just count it in all modes. *Make special warning have count too *Fix regular warning so count actually works instead of always announcing 0
	- Omega via svn r13358: Some countdown and voice improvements for Iron Maidens
	- Omega via svn r13357: bw revision
	- nbluewiz via svn r13356: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r13355: Disable changemt voice on kromog. swaps can occur anywhere between 2-4 stacks depending purely on rng, therefor voice really just cannot be used with any level of accuracy without super complicated code that counts number of tanks, checks who has debuffs and who doesn?\226?\128?\153t. and makes sure there is a viable stackless tank that can taunt. It?\226?\128?\153s just a mess, so removed.
	- Omega via svn r13354: Another tweak
	- Omega via svn r13353: Couple more tweaks to kromog frenzied timers very minor tweak to darmac superheated timer
	- Omega via svn r13352: tweak extender
	- Omega via svn r13351: fix bad spellid
	- Omega via svn r13350: Add another error
	- Omega via svn r13349: Add info about slash here too
	- Omega via svn r13348: Fix some bugs
	- Omega via svn r13347: CN update
	- Omega via svn r13346: Lets give this a go!
	- Omega via svn r13345: Add filter options, on by default, to eliminate warning spam on mythic. Once you are blood ritual or blade rush target, you remain the target for rest of fight, unless you die, so filter spamming special warning to person over and over again, when they know they are the target. Added as option of course in case anyone actually likes this spam.
	- Omega via svn r13344: Working on options now, but translate these
	- Omega via svn r13343: Add personal warning for dark hunt on you, on mythic only. it?\226?\128?\153s inconsequential in non mythic difficulties but on mythic it hits pretty hard.
	- Omega via svn r13342: Fix some errors
	- nbluewiz via svn r13341: # fix possible lua error in mythic blast furnace. # add count for blackhand phase 2 mark of death.
	- ultrashining via svn r13340: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r13339: # Fix lua error when wiped phase 3 in Tectus. # Fix no ship warn if don't show far warning option is disabled. # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r13338: I thought I fixed this message, oh well, fixing now
	- Omega via svn r13337: Well that didn?\226?\128?\153t make it any better. Is there no way to force a dependancy without altering the load order? :\
	- Omega via svn r13336: Try some blind changes to reduce DBT screwing up.
	- Omega via svn r13335: flamebender has 7 minute berserk on mythic
	- Omega via svn r13334: Improve gruul warnings so that non special warnings also show the soak stuff. Added custom yells to blackhand per twitter conversation: https://twitter.com/Mini_Dragon_CN/status/577229097799057408
	- Omega via svn r13333: Make all hud show times adjustable. I?\226?\128?\153m sure there will be a lot of tweaks needed during testing.
	- Omega via svn r13332: CN update
	- Omega via svn r13331: Fix lua error on iron maidens Fix actual cause of tank filter not working still.
	- Omega via svn r13330: Add some work in progress experimental stuff for mythic thogar
	- Omega via svn r13329: Fix bug where hudmap ALWAYS deactivated when FreeEncounterMarker was called, even with other active marks out. Now the smart activate/deactivate actually works perfectly.
	- Omega via svn r13328: Won?\226?\128?\153t be able to test until wed, but this will probably work better.
	- Omega via svn r13327: add debug to istanking. This is only explanation for fail
	- Omega via svn r13326: Tweak thogar grenade scanner to match speed of desecrate weapon, which only worked well at 0.02 (also an instant cast SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS spell).
	- Omega via svn r13325: Tweak thogar countdown a little.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13324: # target scanner: correct fix for ignore tank.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13323: # fix Cauterizing Bolt Dispel.
	- Omega via svn r13322: #Core *includeTank is a pretty useless function, no mod has ever used it and no target scanner I?\226?\128?\153ve ever known of would want to include the tank on purpose. However, ignoreTank, now that is useful. so change to ignoreTank arg to tell target scanner to ignore tank when needed. *This should fix all the false warnings on thogar grenades. It?\226?\128?\153ll just warn unknown when it?\226?\128?\153s on tank instead of false yells/warnings. #Thogar *Add dispel warning for cauterizing bolts that aren?\226?\128?\153t interrupted.
	- Omega via svn r13321: if target scan fails, at least announce something. target scan fails quite often because quite often tank swaps occur and boss doesn?\226?\128?\153t look at grenade target while affected by taunt.
	- Omega via svn r13320: Remove first enkindle timer, he uses it about 3 seconds into fight
	- Omega via svn r13319: reduce spam
	- Omega via svn r13318: ignore tank, and only scan boss. getting MANY false warnings on tanks
	- Omega via svn r13317: Fix a couple swapped timers in GUI
	- nbluewiz via svn r13316: # Add one more Delayed Siege Bomb voice.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13315: # Fixes. 1. Correct Pin Down CD fix. 2. Small Adjust Superheated Shrapnel. 3. Fix bad sync in Iron Maidens. 4. Fix bad Delayed Siege Bomb close warning. # Change. 1. Small tweak for Delayed Siege Bomb warning.
	- Omega via svn r13314: Add bomb voice warning to thogar
	- nbluewiz via svn r13313: # improve delayed siege bomb warning and yell.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13312: # add proto grenade target scanner for thogar.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13311: # fix mythic 35 train timer.
	- Omega via svn r13310: #Thogar Improvements *readd, as a stack warning that warns stacks above or equal to 2 *Improve tank warning so that it warns to taunt at 2 stacks even if you have debuff, if debuff will expire before refresh. instead of making tanks swap at 3 stacks when any good tank knows you swap at 2.
	- Omega via svn r13309: Revert last for now. same debuff is used by both unavoidable flamethrowers and avoidable fire on ground. No way to tell one from the other unfortunately.
	- Omega via svn r13308: Add GTFO for Fire left on ground by Obliterator cannons (burning)
	- nbluewiz via svn r13307: # phase 2 warn fix for iron maidens.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13306: # pin down countdown fix. # fix voice for savage howl. # boat check fix for iron maidens.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r13305: ruRU update
	- nbluewiz via svn r13304: # Blackrock Foundry Fix. 1. Fixed Lumbering Strength warning was shown for non-tank char. 2. Fixed Next Slag Elemental timer was not shown after second spawn. 3. Fixed Blast CD timer was not shown when interval is below 10 sec. 4. Adjusted Pin Down and Tantrum CD little. 5. Fixed boat check. ALTNATE power not working.
	- ultrashining via svn r13303: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r13302: # sharp bark cd fix for rukhmar.
	- Omega via svn r13301: Kromog Update *Fixed bug where call of mountain count never reset *Improved timer accuracy with mythic to account for fact sometimes boss casts trembling earth first. *In addition, smart auto correcting code for all conditions where one ability delays the other.
	- nbluewiz via svn r13300: # koKR update.
	- ultrashining via svn r13299: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r13298: improve message so you know who sent it
	- tandanu via svn r13297: increment version number
