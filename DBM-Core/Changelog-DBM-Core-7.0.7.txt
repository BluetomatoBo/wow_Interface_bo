	- Omega via svn r15256: *Fixed bug where nythendra timers/countdowns would not start correctly on engage if dbm couldn?\226?\128?\153t verify boss energy on pull (causing it to fall back to 0 energy bug mode and start those timers instead. DBM was coded around supporting boss timers even if she bugged out and started with 0 energy instead of 100 like she was doing on beta) *Fixed bug where beta message still showed for Nythendra pull. *Properly localize cenarius message (and shorten it by a lot). Also improved it?\226?\128?\153s visability by displaying it twice now for first pull instead of just once. *Added warnings for dream buff on xavius. If tank or healer spec, it shows all healers or all tanks that got buff when it went out. If a dps, it just tells you whether or not YOU got it. *Added tank taunt warnings for all swaps on fight, including special consideration for 3 tank strat.
