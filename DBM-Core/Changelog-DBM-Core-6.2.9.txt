Tagging as 6.2.9


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.2.9
	- Omega via svn r14421: Bump some mod revisions
	- Omega via svn r14420: fix sortingAsc while at it in case same thing happens there.
	- Omega via svn r14419: Fix switching between two infoframes not clearing nosort.
	- Omega via svn r14418: Add short text to shared fate root.
	- Omega via svn r14417: fix tank filters
	- Omega via svn r14416: Fix infoframe showing after combat end
	- Omega via svn r14415: Change this back to 1.5, the 1.5 was never issue, it was missing unschedule that i fixed Set no sort on gorefiend frame
	- tandanu via svn r14414: use group id for sorting
	- tandanu via svn r14413: InfoFrame: sort by raid roster ID by default
	- Omega via svn r14412: Add a noSort function, which at present doesn?\226?\128?\153t do a damn thing
	- Omega via svn r14411: prevent scheduler activating every single time you enter combat. Remove unneeded GetInstanceInfo every time you enter combat, there is only one function in ALL of DBM that calls scanForCombat with a delay of 0, so this check is pointless.
	- Omega via svn r14410: Add trash warning if a bloodthirster is pulled
	- Omega via svn r14409: level 2
	- Omega via svn r14408: Add debug to scanformobs so its easier to tell when it terminates early (for adjusting scan times)
	- Omega via svn r14407: Use by GUID method so it actually DOES match
	- Omega via svn r14406: Tweak font of corruption filter since it didn?\226?\128?\153t work correctly the other way.
	- Omega via svn r14405: Change infernal icons to match ExRT so they stop conflicting. This of course also means icons will conflict with mark of the legion if they ever occur at same time or if infernals are still up when mark happens, they will be moved off infernal onto mark of legion player :\. However this is still better than having mods conflicting and making marks REALLY useless.
	- Omega via svn r14404: Show mark cast count in the target warnings, it was already in timers just forgot to hook into warning too.
	- Omega via svn r14403: Remove unneeded filter on allure of flames. no reason to check if player is banished or not when allure can?\226?\128?\153t even be used during that phase. Move the SW for it to cast success. Change soon warning to a cast warning and move it to cast start.
	- Omega via svn r14402: Curse packager blows
	- Omega via svn r14401: Don?\226?\128?\153t Register CLEU in hudmap. this should be handled at mod level and pretty much all mods already do this with a free called by SPELL_AURA_REMOVED. Move mainframe out of global table.
	- Omega via svn r14400: Further improve upon GTFO for infernal aoe.
	- Omega via svn r14399: Nothing uses this function.
	- Omega via svn r14398: Update libchatanims
	- Omega via svn r14397: Change interrupt behavior to actually match description of default behavior of resuming where it left off. Changed variable name to ensure old variable never syncs with new. Check if socrethar is channeling exert dominance at the time the barrier drops and there is at least 0.5 seconds left. if he is, show interrupt warning for it and increment interrupt counter. This cast should be included.
	- Omega via svn r14396: Slight tweaks
	- Omega via svn r14395: Speed up doom and gaze warnings if table has 3 targets Add player spellid for fel traps too, so it announces both.
	- Omega via svn r14394: Better way to cancel jubei mirror images timer Some slight timer tweaks Fix Passing invalid UId to istanking Tweak dominator timer for 3rd, 5th
	- Omega via svn r14393: Some debug functions to figure the short yell stuff out.it was working for some but not all?
	- Omega via svn r14392: A few more
	- Omega via svn r14391: Fix scheduler activating if a bad function is passed. if that happens it shouldn?\226?\128?\153t activate at all.
	- Omega via svn r14390: Switch some schedulers that only run once and don?\226?\128?\153t need additional args, to CTimerAfter DBM scheduler is less efficient but needed for additional args. Many of these changed ones are simple run once never again and don?\226?\128?\153t need additional args. Fix bug where runDelayedFunctions ran multiple times
	- Omega via svn r14389: As useful as this debug is. since blizz stopped using these events, I prefer to keep CLEU handler free of extra code.
	- Omega via svn r14388: Switch that call to GetUnitName
	- Omega via svn r14387: Fix another error, maybe
	- Omega via svn r14386: Fix two lua errors
	- Omega via svn r14385: Refactor break timer recovery to store time locally and recovery it from others only if local time not found. Eliminate some redundancy with on load functions by combining BTR and voice pack check together. Throttle updateAllRoster a little more. reducing the ?\226?\128?\156H?\226?\128?\157 syncs just a little more
	- Omega via svn r14384: More code improvements
	- Omega via svn r14383: Add an off by default option to add icons to latent energy. OFF by default. NOT compatible with seeds option. Do not use both!
	- Omega via svn r14382: Shrink hud for strike on velhari a little. so it?\226?\128?\153s useful without being as overbearing. Turn edict hud off by default.
	- Omega via svn r14381: Don?\226?\128?\153t need this anymore, not with defaults nuke
	- Omega via svn r14380: Poke packager
	- Omega via svn r14379: Make no animations (simple) the default bar style. the cpu difference of all the flash is like 50% more. and most don?\226?\128?\153t care about that, so let the defaults be the performance ones. the ones that DO like the extra flash can re-enable it.
	- Omega via svn r14378: Fixes to per mod onupdate handlers so they don?\226?\128?\153t terminate early.
	- Omega via svn r14377: Add BNet_GetToonPresenceID (commented out) for 6.2.2
	- Omega via svn r14376: Tweak
	- Omega via svn r14375: Experimental. DBM scheduler now deactivates when not in use and auto activates when needed. Initial tests show promising but this needs serious testing. This should eliminate all cpu usage from DBM in idle state.
	- Omega via svn r14374: Change leap to a phase timer, for more clarity what timer is actually for (it?\226?\128?\153s not actually for leap, never was)
	- Omega via svn r14373: Fix error
	- Omega via svn r14372: Mythic iskar berserk is 8:30ish. so in between normal and non normals 8 and 9 minute timers.
	- Omega via svn r14371: Add an optional infoframe to zakuun to show up to 10 players who do have latent energy, in case you want to want to enable to it to see who has to go down for soul cleave.
	- Omega via svn r14370: Fixes
	- Omega via svn r14369: *remove complexity from gorefiend infoframe. it never hides so having all that hide code for efficiency actually ended up making it less efficient *On mythic change from being a digest tracker to a soul needed tracker, then back to digest tracker when feast ends.
	- Omega via svn r14368: Some minor things
	- Omega via svn r14367: More mannoroth icon options all off by default Added some trap tracking for socrethar
	- Omega via svn r14366: Fix minor bug with timerSoulCleaveCD not canceling on enrage
	- Omega via svn r14365: As usual, for no reason at all, it doesn?\226?\128?\153t work, so just revert short yells even though there is 0 coding reason it shouldn?\226?\128?\153t have worked. Will just keep long yell text
	- Omega via svn r14364: Apply changes to infoframe on iron reaver too
	- Omega via svn r14363: More protection against lua errors that shouldn?\226?\128?\153t happen, but do for some reason. nil checks for something that should never be nil, but apparently is sometimes.
	- Omega via svn r14362: Tweak some infoframe code, probably breaking it. Add ability to easily specify second spellid to be used for yell text (that differs from option text). Used above to shorten some yells
	- Omega via svn r14361: *Filter offline players from range checker. Had a DK appearing in radar all night who dced mid fight and their dot just hung out with us on radar rest of night. oops. Never considered needing an offline check! *Updated infoframes on mannoroth and archimond show icons by names for custom functions. *Don?\226?\128?\153t check UnitName(?\226?\128?\156player?\226?\128?\157) in infoframe onupdate function. playername isn?\226?\128?\153t going to be changing.
	- Omega via svn r14360: Switch curse of legion to spell cast success
	- nbluewiz via svn r14359: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r14358: and kill mythic yell spam.
	- Omega via svn r14357: Shrink hud size for seeds
	- Omega via svn r14356: Fix it so hudmap duration isn?\226?\128?\153t too short on mythic.
	- Omega via svn r14355: HFC update
	- Omega via svn r14354: CN update
	- Omega via svn r14353: Clean unused
	- Omega via svn r14352: Expand socrethar to have 4 configurable interrupt behaviors. to make sure consistent for entire raid, this can only be set by raid leader. If not set by raid leader, then default option is used by everyone. Update zakuun to make seed method recoverable on mid fight reload/DC
	- Omega via svn r14351: and lower this
	- Omega via svn r14350: Fix gorefiend hud
	- Omega via svn r14349: That?\226?\128?\153s a valid point, these >< don?\226?\128?\153t make sense
	- nbluewiz via svn r14348: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r14347: Change default for large bar from 8 to 11. Option name tweaks
	- Omega via svn r14346: More micro optimizing
	- Omega via svn r14345: A decent compromise between cpu usage and animation of moving bars. The problem with allowing no throttle for animation is that there is almost always a bar moving on fights with many timers. the CPU cost of that smoothness is just not worth it.
	- nbluewiz via svn r14344: # koKR update. # GUI text fix.
	- Omega via svn r14343: Bump curse packager
	- Omega via svn r14342: Try to fix an impossible error reported by someone.
	- tandanu via svn r14341: increment alpha version
