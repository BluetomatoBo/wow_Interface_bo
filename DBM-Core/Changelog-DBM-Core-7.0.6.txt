	- Omega via svn r15239: I don?\226?\128?\153t nkow why this is still erroring so just disable it for now
	- Omega via svn r15238: Ignore blizzards difficulty returned by GetInstanceInfo in mythic+ and use localized text instead. This is because blizzard still calls it challenge mode in this api and was making DBM calling it that

	- Omega via svn r15232: Several timer tweaks/fixes to arcway thanks to Bay?\226?\128?\153s great logs.

	- Omega via svn r15231: Auto hide on reach

	- Omega via svn r15229: if TomTom is not installed, support /way with dbm arrow. Note this is still not intended as a full replacement for TomTom. just a simpler way to invoke a single use arrow. For waypoint queuing of multiple waypoints and the like use TomTom. this just ensures the dbm arrow gets SOME use post 7.1. It shouldn?\226?\128?\153t rot. :\
	- tandanu via svn r15228: increment alpha version
