Tagging as 6.1.8


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.1.8
	- Omega via svn r13725: nil check for good measure
	- Omega via svn r13724: fix bug in last
	- Omega via svn r13723: Found real problem with annihilon. combat log is broken, spell cast start and success fire at same time (even though they are 3 seconds apart). must use UNIT_SPELLCAST_START which fires at ACTUAL cast start. This should fix busted target scanning on annihilon. Added another footman cid to filter while at it for further improvement.
	- Omega via svn r13721: Bump HF revision
	- Omega via svn r13720: DBM hasn?\226?\128?\153t used sendwhisper since wrath, and it won?\226?\128?\153t use it again. So remove all options related to it.
	- Omega via svn r13719: Remove all timers from garrison invasion bosses, because the bosses all use scalable cd tech based on number of players, cds are shorter more players in raid, which makes it impossible for any semblance of timer accuracy. Lets hope blizzard NEVER does this on a real boss
	- Omega via svn r13718: PUsh more iskar fixes Add ability to disable timers globally
	- Omega via svn r13711: Move some utility functions out of mods and into core, i have a feeling they will be used again (zakuun)
	- Omega via svn r13710: Some zakuun fixes
	- Omega via svn r13707: Push the xhul timers. I?\226?\128?\153ll do more voice work, and advanced options later Tweak a couple timers that were 0.3 seconds off.
	- Omega via svn r13704: Add option to disable the respawn timer while at it.
	- Omega via svn r13703: change all 30 second respawns to 29.5. it?\226?\128?\153s not an exact science but the respawn timers is 29.5-31 but it?\226?\128?\153s better to error on the earliest vs latest. Change wipe nag message code to no longer use math random and now just always show on mods that being out of date on is bad. Shorten message some. Fix issue where reap timer would not cancel at 30% on hellfire council
	- Omega via svn r13702: bwversion
	- Omega via svn r13699: Some fixes to ai timer logic, so it won?\226?\128?\153t break if feature is disabled. Added support for AI timers to learn new phase timers too, in addition to first pull timers and regular cd timers Some tweaks to kormrok and zakuun mods based on new spellids and dungeon journal updates
	- Omega via svn r13698: fix bug where respawn time was showing on kills
	- Omega via svn r13694: bw version
	- Omega via svn r13690: Finish assault work. When I say finish, i mean functional state that?\226?\128?\153s good enough for now, but always room for improvement.
	- Omega via svn r13687: Fix darmac so it honors the hud overrides
	- Omega via svn r13683: Gruul and thogar respawn times
	- Omega via svn r13682: Attempt to fix ai timer error with first casts
	- Omega via svn r13681: bump BW revision
	- Omega via svn r13680: Fix more teluur errors
	- Omega via svn r13678: Push teluur bugfixes to live Push more text to the AI Timer option on why it?\226?\128?\153s disabled for add cds Push Mannoroth drycode Push tweaks and AI timers to Assault, Council, socrethar
	- ebmor via svn r13676: DBM-GUI/localization.en: fix trailing points; deDE update
	- Omega via svn r13675: Fix rare nil error in timer auto correct
	- Omega via svn r13674: Debug cleanup
	- Omega via svn r13673: One fix to auto correct
	- Omega via svn r13672: Better wording
	- Omega via svn r13671: Add Advanced feature to auto correct timers that are too long (off by default) Added Advanced feature to auto generate timers for brand new untested boss encounters (on by default)
	- Omega via svn r13669: Socrethar drycode
	- Omega via svn r13668: ?\226?\128?\156My CPU is a neural net processor; a learning computer.?\226?\128?\157
	- Omega via svn r13667: Antispam all tank warnings, never show double warnings. If a special warning is shown, that is ALL that is shown, else, show the stack counter when no special warning is shown.
	- Omega via svn r13666: CN update
	- Omega via svn r13665: bugfixes, test button
	- Omega via svn r13664: All options are complete and hooked up to actual HUD now. they should all function. Now just need to write a test function and attach it to a new button so options can be tested.
	- Omega via svn r13663: SPelling, two more translations that aren?\226?\128?\153t hooked into GUI yet
	- Omega via svn r13662: GUI work done, texture options not hooked up yet Fixed errors from last
	- Omega via svn r13661: GUI is not ready yet, but started support for configurable HUD options for colors and sizes, to make it more user controllable and a lot more color blind friendly
	- Omega via svn r13659: Velharl
	- Omega via svn r13655: Push some fixes
	- Omega via svn r13654: Push Iskar As small as that commit looks, i spent a lot of time analyzing best way to handle the pausing and extension of his abilities (similar or koragh). I still don?\226?\128?\153t think it?\226?\128?\153s perfect, but it?\226?\128?\153ll be somewhat there.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r13650: ruRU update
	- Omega via svn r13649: Bump BW version
	- Omega via svn r13647: Push few bugfixes to ironreaver timer code Push Kromogs respawn timer Push updated gorefiend mod
	- Omega via svn r13646: Reduce marked for death voiceover. Especially since ?\226?\128?\156find shelter?\226?\128?\157 doesn?\226?\128?\153t make sense when in phase 3. Now it?\226?\128?\153ll either be ?\226?\128?\156find shelter or ?\226?\128?\156left?\226?\128?\157 ?\226?\128?\156right?\226?\128?\157 ?\226?\128?\156center?\226?\128?\157
