Tagging as 6.2.22


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.2.22
	- Omega via svn r14943: Also, add infoframe to scorpyron too

	- Omega via svn r14938: Fix lua error in Ursok Finish xavius mod Fix missing count from combat start timers on Krosus Change archimonde hud line for player wrought chaos from green to yellow. Green is typically the positive ?\226?\128?\156goto this other person?\226?\128?\157 line. yellow is the bad  on player and red is the bad not on player line color. Changed iskar with same change. This may confuse at first but it makes more sense going forward. Especially on fights like xavius that literally have two separate mechanics using lines (green line, run to player, yellow line, run out with partner player, red line, not on you but stay out of it?\226?\128?\153s way)

	- Omega via svn r14930: Make auto accept invites work for non battle.net friends too
