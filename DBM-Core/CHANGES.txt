    Fixed a bug where numBoss was basically always nil except where SetBossHPInfoToHighest was used. This will finally make the wipe messages include boss counts etc on global level, like intended years ago when it was added.
    While at it, made the bosses left code more robust in core to avoid errors in off chance the variable gets accessed before it is recovered by timerrecovery (such as user DCing mid fight.

    Fixed bug in GetUnitIdFromGUID that caused it to never actually work for boss UnitIds, this will actually fix a minor bug in the ONLY mod that was using that function until now, triad.
    Added support for CID as an option for GetUnitIdFromGUID as well
    Added additional timer updates to blockade for pull and translocate, so the update doesn?\226?\128?\153t have to wait til first cast of fight or after translocate.
    Added option to Changed boss distance check to check boss instead of tank, but with a fallback to revert to tank if item check fails(which it does depending on npc/boss flags)
    Fixed bug where range radar had headers backwards between regular and reverse
    Updated range checker to support a couple new ranges with some more item testing, and fixed two that were wrong
