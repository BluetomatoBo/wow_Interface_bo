    *Removed all target/personal warnings for touch of sargeras, there is no way to detect that
    *Fixed phase 2 detection for fallen avatar if maiden dies instead of heals the avatar
    *Changed icons used by shadowy blades to start at 1 instead of 3
    *Added icons and icon based yells to dark mark and made sure compatible with BW marking.
    *scrapped hardcoded timer sequences as it just doesn?\226?\128?\153t work that way. they look consistent between pulls for same group, but compare two diff groups and they are radically different, indicating timer variance is actually caused by strategy/dps/some other factor that?\226?\128?\153s currently unknown. For now standard lowest observed CD will be used
    *Really fix infoframe this time i hope, and also make sure it closes on phase 2 start
    *Made corrupted matrix warning more clear so it says ?\226?\128?\156move to Pylon beam?\226?\128?\157 not ?\226?\128?\156move to target?\226?\128?\157
    *Fixed missing spell ID on dark mark timer
