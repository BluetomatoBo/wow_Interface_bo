    #Helya Update
    *Phase 2 and Phase 3 mythic helya timer updates
    *Updated icon code for phase 3 orbs to reflect that tanks are excluded exclusively on Mythic
    *Updated orb timers to reflect which type of dps will be picked by orbs in next set
    *Added counts to fury of the maw
    *Fixed some incorrect fury of maw timers for non mythic difficulty
    *Changed add timer to now start at fury of maw cast begin(mythic)/end(nonmythic) to show add spawns in 7 seconds instead of having a redundant add timer up entire time when it?\226?\128?\153s just same as fury of the maw.
    *Changed taunt warning for anchor to no longer fire if other tank is > 18 yards away (mythic basically)
    *Improved timer handling for fury of maw for non mythic difficulty so you get a timer for first one in phase 2 now.
    *Fixed warning for mist infusion to be a cast warning now not a target warning. Added cast bars for it (per add) and antispam warning if two cast it at exact same time. Also made warning off by default since it?\226?\128?\153s quite often and quite spammy. It?\226?\128?\153s quite important too so those who need it should turn it on, but it shouldn?\226?\128?\153t spam EVERYONE if it?\226?\128?\153s not their job.
    *Added warnings/timers for give no quarter.
    *Disabled anchor timer in LFR (it doesn?\226?\128?\153t get cast there)
    *Fixed normal anchor timer, it?\226?\128?\153s longer on normal than it is on heroic/mythic
    *Fixed bug where lantern timer wasn?\226?\128?\153t canceling on mob death for Night Watch Mariner
    *Added fetid rot timer
    *Probably other stuff I forgot
    *Possibly new bugs, so much code changed.
    *Minor Text Fixes
    
    ****Note to localizers. The new orb timer needs localizing. Please do so ASAP. I want to get a release out soon.
