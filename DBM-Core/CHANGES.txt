    Prepare to release. There may (and probably are) bugs in this release, but the scope of what needs testing needs more than just one person using the mod, so an open beta is a must and the testing is time constrained too (heroic warfronts alliance side)

    **THIS UPDATE REQUIRES A CLIENT RESTART
    *Added countdown yells for tank debuffs on Sivara
    *Updated audio countdown object in timers to support custom countdowns for everything (just like special warnings). This means that you are no longer limited to 3 voices, you can actually have unlimitted voices during an encounter via the mod dropdowns. There are still 3 core voice options which will be used as defaults, exactly like special warnings work, and just like special warnings, you can define those default voices in core spoken alert setup.
    *Oh and one more surprise, A new built in countdown option has been added. SmoothMcGroove!
