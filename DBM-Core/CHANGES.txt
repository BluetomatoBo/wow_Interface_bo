    Kr Update
    Updated Mythic Timer for Torment per April 30 Hotfixes to Uunat
    Updated LFR-Heroic torment timer to support fact it's a scaling timer based on raid size
    Reverted a bug fix to playSound function that caused it to choose dialog over master channel, when the force use master flag is true. People got used to the behavior of this bug and it doesn't really do any harm to leave it be.
