Tagging as 6.0.16


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 6.0.16
	- Omega via svn r12955: Add option to filter self from hud. On by default. Hud not useful on self, that's just spam most of time except for ranged based hud functions like gruul. Could be done in a cleaner way i'm sure but that can go into TOM_RUS next refactor. The check should be in hudmap and not have to be put in every mod.
	- Omega via svn r12954: update the timers, but not the countdowns. this method is still far from accurate, too inaccurate for countdowns.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r12953: ruRU update
	- Omega via svn r12952: Optional rapid fire near you warning, with smart code to disable regular warning if it goes off.
	- Omega via svn r12951: Fix a bug where trash warning would warn for non tanks being bad and being in front of trash mob Added experimental timer correction code to blackhand, for when marked for death will delay smash. detect this well ahead of time and auto update smash timer/countdown. this experimental code only will run if debug mode enabled. Fixed bug in blastfurnacemod
	- Omega via svn r12950: disable experimental method if debugmode not enabled. this way. it doesn't interfere with tagging a release.
	- Omega via svn r12949: tweak/fix
	- Omega via svn r12948: change call the pack to a tank warning default. the adds dying is lowest priority on fight in normal/heroic and mythic. they do inconsequential damage so long as they are tanked. It's more important to reduce spam so dps and healers can focus on things that are actually important. Change two timers to next timers. the timers are close to next timers, but can be delayed by tantrum. tantrum is the only next timer that is never ever delayed. it's his highest priority spell.
	- Omega via svn r12947: Force reset pin down option too since it's fixed
	- Omega via svn r12946: Push refactoring to fix more bugs
	- Omega via svn r12945: fix pin down sound not working
	- Omega via svn r12944: Bump BW revision
	- Omega via svn r12943: Fix start combat timers too for all difficulties
	- Omega via svn r12942: Some antispam hacks for iron maidens.
	- Omega via svn r12941: description update
	- Omega via svn r12940: Still don't like fluidness of it so smooth it out a tiny bit more.
	- Omega via svn r12939: another tweak
	- Omega via svn r12938: more debug. hopefully i can test this a good amount of time tonight and make it ready for release, if not, i'll just scrap it so I can do stable release after raid.
	- Omega via svn r12937: Attempt to fix strange lua error on hansgar & Franzok
	- nbluewiz via svn r12936: # consecutive missing yells found on mythic thogar. he ramdomly forgot yell on 13th 14th train. fix this. (even that occurs, prev method only breaking 15, 16th warn. works correctly after 16th.)
	- ultrashining via svn r12935: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r12934: Blizz stealth nerfed hanzgar and franzok on friday, removing the 6 minute berserk. Unknown what new berserk is. Verified multiple sources though that berserk was 6 minutes on tues and wed, but all kills friday-saturday, it's gone. So this hotfix probably went live thursday night/friday morning.
	- Omega via svn r12933: CN update
	- Omega via svn r12932: Cooldown always returns 0, even if you don't know spell, so always true 100% of time, filter broken Therefor, reverse logic, if ANY of them return NOT 0, then filter
	- nbluewiz via svn r12931: # correct fix for thogar.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12930: # more dps's dispel.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12929: # missed this.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12928: # limit fake yell for thogar.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12927: # fix mythic thogar timer.
	- Omega via svn r12926: Option, code, and a few mods
	- nbluewiz via svn r12925: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12924: Translate this too, option/code not done yet.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12923: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12922: GUI option
	- Omega via svn r12921: ##Add filter option to filter non raid wiping interrupts by target/focus. Some interrupts are too important to ever filter. so filter not applied to all interrupts, just ones that it's ok to miss some of them. #Also, re-added tank/distance filter to repair interrupt on blast furnace. I've done fight 3x now and the engineers now always go to closest regulator, not lowest health one, meaning it's once again safe to filter engineers on opposite side. This improves phase 1 filtering.
	Working on GUI stuff now for this filter and another one I'm also working on.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12920: # sync below25.
	- Omega via svn r12919: On mythic iron maidens don't cancel 3rd boat timer until 20%. there is no grace period like non mythic has.
	- Omega via svn r12918: fixes
	- nbluewiz via svn r12917: # fix option saving after default option loaded.
	- Omega via svn r12916: One more fix
	- Omega via svn r12915: Fix a bug that would cause jump scanning to fail. If last jump is unknown, it should never attempt to use faster method as it would fail horribly. Added more debug to analyze it now that this fix is in.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12914: # health stuff for blast furnace. # fix voice for normal and heroic thogar.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12913: # fix lua error in dmf rings.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12912: # SPELL_PERIODIC_MISSED not fires actually. # Cave In warning for Gruul. # Remove unneeded table from Iron Maidens. (NOTE: hud hightlight texture shown as green because not exists.) # Fix normal and heroic train data after 26. (i was hit by train because dbm 27 train is bad.)
	- ultrashining via svn r12911: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r12910: add a 0.5 buffer to rangecheck, because blizz uses some kind of internal rounding that may falsely round down or up. so yardage could be off by + or - 0.5.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12909: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r12908: Add thogar raid split special warning Fix one error in expectedTime
	- nbluewiz via svn r12907: # comment clean.
	- ultrashining via svn r12906: zhTW update
	- nbluewiz via svn r12905: # thogar mythic update.
	- Omega via svn r12904: Forgot to remove this
	- Omega via svn r12903: #Darmac update *Hopefully fix bug that caused timers not to update when darmac dismounted on mythic difficulty *Fixed bug where epicenter warnings were missing when cast by faultine *Fixed bug where epicenter warnings cast by darmac would spam *Added GTFO warnings for inferno pyre, Flame infusion, and Epicenter *Added timer and countdown for epicenter *Fixed a bug where call of the pack and pin down could incorrectly update *Fixed a bug where not all timers would update on beast death on mythic difficulty (absorbing a beast now seems to reset ALL ability cds despite boss already being dismounted ahead of time, not just one absorbed on mythic difficulty)
	- Omega via svn r12902: Fix two bugs
	- Omega via svn r12901: do not reset tantrumCount
	- nbluewiz via svn r12900: # re-enable timer extend code for margok. just extend timers below 10 sec by 10 sec.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12899: # change option default for healer.
	- Omega via svn r12898: Add thogar notes.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12897: # berserk hotfixed in Kromog.
	- Omega via svn r12896: don't show warnRetchedBlackrock if you already saw a special warning for same cast. Added count to acid torrent.
	- Omega via svn r12895: Mythic Kromog updates
	- nbluewiz via svn r12894: # bw version
	- Omega via svn r12893: revert callback change, that made it worse. honestly the no strip hack needs to be changed. it logs terrible messages.
	- Omega via svn r12892: Add another trash warning
	- Omega via svn r12891: another highmaul hud, this time for MC targets on koragh
	- Omega via svn r12890: Reduce size of blood ritual hud, since it has a much smaller radius of avoidance in game as well, and to also deemphasize the orb size for melee. Rapid fire is more important one to emphasize Add some Hud options to margok
	- nbluewiz via svn r12889: # add range frame for acrane vol on trash mod. # flame jet gtfo for kargath. # fix expel magic fire cd for koragh.
	- nbluewiz via svn r12888: # increase bomb scanning time for thogar.

	- nbluewiz via svn r12883: # change to 9 sec waring.
	- Omega via svn r12882: Update notes
	- Omega via svn r12881: re-enable it i guess. but leave it as "soon"
	- Omega via svn r12880: Disable useless warning for now.
	- Omega via svn r12879: Hansgar and Franzok jump warnings. Added support to core for target scanner filtering by targetname. Needed by hansgar and franzok method.
	- Omega via svn r12878: add nil check to thogar targetname. i saw at least one that had bad target. (possibly died during cast)
	- Omega via svn r12877: Comment out that for now, since sometimes, it nil errors. just so users dont have to have errors while i'm still raiding and can't finish what i started there.
	- Omega via svn r12876: tweak hud update rate, 0.05 was a little sluggish. 0.04 looks better
	- nbluewiz via svn r12875: # fix train 12 bug.
	- Omega via svn r12874: Notes
	- Omega via svn r12873: Mythic Thogar update
	- Omega via svn r12872: Pass text to callback, not message, to prevent transcriptor logs from logging bad messages
	- Omega via svn r12871: Fix proto grenade spam on mythic (always casts 2)
	- Omega via svn r12870: Switch onupdate frame to ticker. reduces hudmap cpu usage by 50% without adversely affecting animations. tests are showing hudmap went to 0.4ms per cycle to 0.2ms per cycle when a single animation is present.
	- Omega via svn r12869: Fixes for dogs rapidly changing target like 0.04 seconds after selecting previous target
	- Omega via svn r12868: bw version
	- Omega via svn r12867: stupid.
	- TOM_RUS via svn r12866: This should fix nil error
	- Omega via svn r12865: Notes
	- TOM_RUS via svn r12864: Should be working this time
	- nbluewiz via svn r12863: # revert end Searing Plates warning for hansgar. # delay timer cancel on boat. # faster lane warning and Delayed Siege Bomb for thogar.
	- Omega via svn r12862: This should probably fix that nil
	- Omega via svn r12861: possibly fix some hud nil errors
	- Omega via svn r12860: 6 min berserk on mythic gruul as well Fix first rippling smash timer on kromog
	- Omega via svn r12859: Update inferno slice for mythic, cast time of inferno slice was lowered since mythic testing. offsetting timers by 1 second.
	- Omega via svn r12858: Add mythic berserk to hans and frans
	- Omega via svn r12857: Fix blast timer bug
	- Omega via svn r12856: Some debug
	- Omega via svn r12855: And color change. green seems to positive for a negative debuff
	- Omega via svn r12854: Fix some durations
	- Omega via svn r12853: Revert to last working state. the refactoring had a ridiculous number of errors. every time one was fixed only found another one. It didn't seem to be registering or clearing any callbacks at all.
	- Omega via svn r12852: Actually that last fix did work
	- Omega via svn r12851: Fix a bug where it was canceling old timers too soon. It's still not fully fixed though because right now it's canceling ALL bars. which is a bug because it should only cancel bar with passed arg.
	- Omega via svn r12850: That actually wasn't issue. sometimes, it's just nil all together, not even sure how it's possible.
	- Omega via svn r12849: Strange, sometimes, DBMHudMap is nil when upvalue is created, so just avoid that issue by not creating upvalue for it. it shouldn't be nil by time it's used Hopefully fix http://prntscr.com/63o5bp Man TOM you made a mess before bed :P
	- Omega via svn r12848: Try to fix this error http://prntscr.com/63nzkp If it doesn't, i may have to temp revert callback changes so people can get through raids without so many errors.
