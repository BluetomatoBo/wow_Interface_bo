Tagging as 7.0.3


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 7.0.3
	- Omega via svn r15178: Bump BW version, and fix an error with upgrading it
	- Omega via svn r15177: Revert last, apparently that api crashes wow
	- Omega via svn r15176: Also do TalkingHeadFrame_CloseImmediately() when unregistering
	- Omega via svn r15175: Fix one last bug i think
	- Omega via svn r15174: More tweaks
	- Omega via svn r15173: Debug messages
	- Omega via svn r15172: More error protection
	- Omega via svn r15171: more tweaks
	- Omega via svn r15170: Add a safety in case it loads first
	- Omega via svn r15169: Fix talking head still not being disabled when it first loads
	- Omega via svn r15168: change order so it?\226?\128?\153s properly progressive
	- ultrashining via svn r15167: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r15166: Fix lua errors if talkinghead isn?\226?\128?\153t loaded yet
	- Omega via svn r15165: Tweak wording
	- Omega via svn r15164: Missed this spot
	- Omega via svn r15163: Commit Talking head blocker
	- Omega via svn r15162: Improve start combat debug so it doesn?\226?\128?\153t show in any event where it?\226?\128?\153s not ACTUALLY allowed
	- Omega via svn r15161: Add 1 second delay to mod load
	- Omega via svn r15160: Delete demonic invasions mod, and disable world events from loading outdoors automatically, since for some reason this is causing lua errors for some users, beyond any explanation.
	- Omega via svn r15159: Ignore Hotfix syncs from mods that have higher revision if our revision is under 1000 (it means our revision is ACTUALLY newer because our mod is from new repo).
MysticalOS:
	- Update pkgmeta
subversion:
	- Omega via svn r15158: Prune warlords mods from dbm-Core
	- ultrashining via svn r15157: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r15156: More work on restriction mode. apply restrictions to emerald nightmare mods and any draenor mods (except iron maidens, the mod is literally neutered without position checks for boat phase. I can only hope blizzard adds an event for boat ending or that mod is totally screwed)
	- Omega via svn r15155: Time to promote these to Legion cat
	- Omega via svn r15154: Fixes to range frame in restrictive mode Add notices when things can?\226?\128?\153t be enabled in restrictive mode.
	- Omega via svn r15153: Restore this to tank check
	- Omega via svn r15152: CN update
	- Omega via svn r15151: more refactoring
	- Omega via svn r15150: Fix range radar breaking from earlier refacttoring, GetPlayerMapAreaID really is utter shit. i hope they fix this before 7.1 if we ever hope to filter stuff not in same zone.
	- Omega via svn r15149: Add localization for 7.1 errors, to give plenty of time for translate
	- Omega via svn r15148: More refactoring in more functions to remove more UnitPositions. this will cause some regressions in some things since GetPlayerMapAreaID is an inferior replacement that sometimes doesn?\226?\128?\153t return a good value. However without UnitPosition, GetPlayerMapAreaID is only way to really do unit to unit mapid comparisons for a lot of filters.
	- Omega via svn r15147: Another tweak
	- Omega via svn r15146: More range frame tweaks
	- Omega via svn r15145: Some range frame refactoring so that UnitPosition is only used in radar method and text method only uses UnitDistanceSquared. (this of course still assumes blizzard isn?\226?\128?\153t breaking UnitDistanceSquared too, we shall see).
	- Omega via svn r15144: Fix normal to use 30, 10, 30, 10. It was every 40 like LFR in an earlier test but the final test they did it used heroic/mythic timers
	- Omega via svn r15143: Link to website version so no one can make any complaints
	- Omega via svn r15142: lower this CD
	- Omega via svn r15141: add in game notice
	- Omega via svn r15140: Disable all hudmap functions in nighthold. No one will ever get to see these :\
	- Omega via svn r15139: Fix regression in spanish locals. Don?\226?\128?\153t overwrite entire table .en table, just update table entries.
	- Omega via svn r15138: use EXPANSION_NAME6 now that it?\226?\128?\153s available
	- Omega via svn r15137: Change back to 34, it seems that some bosses it?\226?\128?\153s 34 and some it?\226?\128?\153s 50. I?\226?\128?\153m not really going to put the effort into building a list of which bosses have which for a temp event, so just leaving timers at 34
	- Omega via svn r15136: just stop all timers on SCENARIO_COMPLETED. SCENARIO_UPDATE was unreliable
	- Omega via svn r15135: Seems blizzard nerfed these cds
	- Omega via svn r15134: remove spanish from help message
	- Omega via svn r15133: Massive Spanish update thanks to Orden
	- Omega via svn r15132: Add chaos wave
	- Omega via svn r15131: fix a timer
	- Omega via svn r15130: Fix bigwigs version display
	- ebmor via svn r15129: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r15128: Small timer tweak
	- Omega via svn r15127: Change special warning slider behaviors to disable flash or sound when not appropriate to what slider does.
	- Omega via svn r15126: Fix option default for skovald
	- Omega via svn r15125: Cenarius 1. Fixed nightmare brambles timer not starting after first cast in each phase. 2. Added rotten breath timer 3. Updated touch of life timer for normal/LFR (heroic/mythic unchanged until reviewed.) 4. Fixed bug where touch of life timer wouldn?\226?\128?\153t show if you weren?\226?\128?\153t targetting caster Ursok 1. Fixed missing roaring cacophony timer for first cast.
	- Omega via svn r15124: Fix breath detection on Nythendra, since blizzard added it to the spells pruned from combat log fine tuned some nythendra timers.
	- Omega via svn r15123: Minor Renferal tweaks. Ilgy?\226?\128?\153noth 1. Added ground slam timer 2. Added final torpor 3. Added timers for first nightmarish fury of each phase 4. Added timer for first eye of fate cast by each new spawned add now that the add has a clean way to grab it?\226?\128?\153s GUID after it spawns (sadly still 4 seconds slower than EMOTE for actual spawn warning)
	- Omega via svn r15122: Further filter blazing hellfire
	- Omega via svn r15121: Minor Text Fixes
	- Omega via svn r15120: Update to support BW new git based version code. Should be able to version check BW again. Untested!
	- tandanu via svn r15119: increment alpha version
