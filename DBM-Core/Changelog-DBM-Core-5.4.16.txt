Tagging as 5.4.16


--------------------

subversion:
	- increment version number to 5.4.16
	- Omega via svn r11339: Fix this too
	- Omega via svn r11334: Fix block warning on paragons 10 man. Another bug that i can't believe wasn't reporting months ago. Tells me how few used feature I guess.
	- Omega via svn r11328: Remove no longer needed yell trigger for immerseus. Translate one-five to spanish on paragons. these can't possibly be wrong right? :)
	- Omega via svn r11317: Ox has wrong win yell
	- Omega via svn r11316: Sort updates
	- Omega via svn r11315: More mod management so mods don't need updating in 6.0, only core.
	- tandanu via svn r11311: fix hugebar X/Y offset options
	- Omega via svn r11310: Better way
	- Omega via svn r11309: Disable EE on norushen
	- Omega via svn r11307: Add in disable for 6.0 on this version. TRUST ME. You do not want this version loading on 6.0, the lua errors would CRIPPLE gameplay and freeze the user from the GUID changes alone. DBM 6.0 will be a mandatory update.
	- ebmor via svn r11303: deDE update
	- Omega via svn r11296: This should be merged to live to because it's easier to manage mods in general when they use core functions instead of custom ones.
	- oscarucb via svn r11291: fix Rook's Clash timer
	- ultrashining via svn r11290: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r11289: shorten nova cd, change timer type
	- Omega via svn r11288: remove debug line
	- Omega via svn r11287: For some reason, it returns two warnings, unknown and actual target, so just filter unknown like this. I'm not sure why the function ever returns anything other than target name or nil though. Can't find any code that would make it return "unknown" but it is sometimes.
	- Omega via svn r11286: apparently this has been broken since the pull handling of world bosses was changed. the combat_yell method doesn't support partial matches. No wonder the pull alerts stopped working.
	- Omega via svn r11285: change chiji target scanning speed, needs to be a lot slower for that
	- Omega via svn r11284: Improve chiji to give beacon target and runto warning. Other minor world boss tweaks
	- Omega via svn r11283: Fix re-engage bug in treasure trove of thunder king scenario
	- Omega via svn r11282: Add debug to world boss alert stuff cause it hasn't been working last few days, something broke it
	- Omega via svn r11281: Don't allow over 9
	- Omega via svn r11280: fix custom sound paths
	- Omega via svn r11279: add mysterious difficulties 18 and 19.
	- Omega via svn r11278: Support custom sounds if a user creates a folder named DBM-CustomSounds and puts ogg files in there following naming format "Custom1.ogg" "Custom2.ogg" etc. Because this is a user created folder, files will never be replaced by a DBM update. Better than asking user to always redrag files into existing DBM folders. After this, since no GUI yet (not sure I'll even add one) you must set CustomSounds to the number of sounds you added so they register with LSM. Setting this wrong will register blank sounds (which is why it's not in GUI)
	- Omega via svn r11277: fix that so it's not backwards
	- Omega via svn r11276: Here too
	- Omega via svn r11275: Go back to only blocking cinematics inside instances
	- Omega via svn r11274: Also, cancel phase 3 timers off phase 4 pre yell, since he stops casting here. of course still best to start phase 4 timers on actual phase 4 start, as well as continue canceling timers there as well for those we do not have localization for.
	- Omega via svn r11273: Cancel realm timer/countdown if the phase ends early (he reaches 10% while in realm)
	- tandanu via svn r11272: increment version number
