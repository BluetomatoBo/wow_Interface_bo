This AddOn was originally design to display any damage meter as overlay in a configurable data text. 

This module show configurable datatext with information from you damage meter, as your personal dps or hps.
When you mouse over it an overlay will shown with the detail information from you raid/group.
So you don't need to have open the main window of the damage meter in the screen, just mouse over to see the data.

The damage meters currently support are Recount & Skada. 

Original created during Cataclysm I've recently update and upgrade the code.
